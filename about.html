							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<span class="image left"><img src="engineering/images/sailbotrc.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>When not building things, I can be found rowing, sailing, hiking, making stained glass art, and wishing to pet every dog that walks past. I haven't always been interested in engineering by name but I always have liked to build things, from challenging myself to build a dollhouse entirely out of paper and tape to making the Globe Theatre out of cake for a seventh grade project. </p>
							<p>I started my degree in Biology, actually, at the University of Edinburgh, but was upset when their strict curriculum kept me from taking physics and math. I transferred to the University of Pittsburgh to do Bioengineering but realized I really just liked the physics and math, and that I loved working with my hands: prototyping. This led me to Mechanical Engineering and product development.</p>
							<p>While at Pitt, I founded a club that builds an autonomous sailboat, designed a device that connects Deaf children with music and dance, completed three rotations at a medical device company, and built a unicycle-powered pot stirrer; I've learned to embrace my creative, sometimes unorthodox, ideas as a strength rather than a weakness. It's no longer about <i> if </i>  I can do it, but <i> how</i>.
							<p>My interests lie in <b>human-centered design, medical devices, robotics,</b> and <b>reducing waste in our oceans</b>. A lifetime goal of mine is to invent something using compliant mechanisms that reduces waste in the medical industry.</p>
							<p>In addition, I competed at Head of the Charles rowing regatta in 2023 and sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in the fall of 2021.</p>
